"""
In the realm of code, you shall find
A concept that weaves, the recursive kind
A loop that dances with an elegant grace
Unfolding mysteries, at a steady pace

Like a mirror reflecting its own reflection
Recursion delves into endless introspection
It calls upon itself, a noble call
Seeking answers, within its own thrall

Imagine a fractal, breathtakingly grand
With patterns repeating, across the land
Recursive functions, in a majestic array
Solving puzzles, in a mystical way

First, a base case, so simple and pure
Where the recursion ends, no more to endure
But behold, as the function reawakens its might
To explore the depths, in a recursive flight

Line by line, it chips away, relentless and bold
Splitting problems, into pieces, untold
It dives deeper, with each chosen path
Into the labyrinth, of an algorithmic bath

Like echoes bouncing, from wall to wall
Recursion conquers problems, both big and small
A problem within a problem, a tale to unfold
As layers unfurl, and secrets are told

Yet, tread with caution, for infinite loops may lie
A never-ending cycle, staying high in the sky
Base cases forgotten, like whispers in the night
Recursion loses itself, in an eternal blight

So, programmers, embrace recursion's might
As it paints symphonies, in code, so bright
Uncover its powers, with a curious heart
And let recursion, your solutions impart.
